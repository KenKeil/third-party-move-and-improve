# Lab 100: Lifting A Third Party Application to the Cloud

## Introduction
This lab walks you through the steps to capture an image of an existing, on-prem third party application. First you will capture a .ova file of the application and convert it to a cloud compatible .vmdk file. From there you will import the .vmdk to Object Storage and then create a cloud-native server that will use the file as a custom image.

### Objectives
* Learn how to create a cloud-compatible VMDK file
* Learn how to leverage Object Storage
* Learn how to provision cloud infrastructure (networking, routing, compute)
* Learn how to deploy cloud-native servers

### Required Artifacts
* The following lab requires an Oracle Public Cloud account. You may use your own cloud account, a cloud account that you obtained through a trial, or a training account whose details were given to you by an Oracle instructor.
* Estimated time to complete this lab is three hours.
